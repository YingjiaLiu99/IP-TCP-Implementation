# IP-TCP-Implementation
A complete TCP/IP protocol built from scratch in Go, replicating real-world protocol behaviors including socket management, TCB, 3-way handshake, and teardown. Implemented sliding window protocol, send/receive buffers, zero window probing, and robust retransmission logic based on RTT and RTO.
